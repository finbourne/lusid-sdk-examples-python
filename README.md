## Contents

The demo scripts show the SDK in a natural setting and show how the Lusid SDK can be used for a variety of operations.

The tutorials aim to highlight specific features in the form of test suites. These are more useful for demonstrating advanced features and behaviours of the SDK.

## Getting Started

Visit the [SDK repository's wiki](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python-preview/wiki) for information on setting up API credentials and running the examples.

## Running the tests

In the src directory, run `poetry install` to install all dependencies, then `poetry shell` to start a shell in a virtual environment with all dependencies installed.

Finally, run `pytest` to run all tests.
