## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**instruments** | [**dict(str, LusidInstrument)**](LusidInstrument.md) | The collection of instruments to translate.                Each instrument definition should be keyed by a unique correlation id. This id is ephemeral  and is not stored by LUSID. It serves only as a way to easily identify each instrument in the response.                Any instrument that is not already in the LUSID dialect should be given as an ExoticInstrument. | 
**dialect** | **str** | The target dialect that the given instruments should be translated to. |
